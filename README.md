# Financial Ratio Analysis of Top Indian Corporations

## Project Overview
This project evaluates how **India’s corporate fundamentals stand amid recent global economic shocks**.  
In **August 2025**, the U.S. imposed **50% tariffs on Indian exports**, risking losses of **$35–50 billion** across key sectors like **gems, textiles, and auto components**.  
Yet, India’s **NIFTY index trades near all-time highs**, showing strong investor confidence despite policy headwinds.  

This divergence raised an important question:  
 *Which large Indian companies are structurally resilient enough to thrive despite such shocks?*

## Approach

- Computed **key financial ratios** (Profitability, Liquidity, Efficiency, Leverage)  
- Built a **Python-powered framework** to automate ratio calculation  
- Visualised trends for each company over **5 years**  
- Interpreted results in the context of **tariffs & market resilience**

## Companies Analysed
