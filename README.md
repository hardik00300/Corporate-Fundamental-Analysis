## 📌 Project Overview
This project evaluates how **India’s corporate fundamentals stand amid recent global economic shocks**.  
In **August 2025**, the U.S. imposed **50% tariffs on Indian exports**, risking losses of **$35–50 billion** across key sectors like **gems, textiles, and auto components**.
